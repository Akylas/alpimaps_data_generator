//! Rendering terrain-RGB tiles.
//!
//! Ports the encoding half of `scripts/build_terrain_rgb.py`. The vertical quantisation ramp is
//! the part that matters for size: elevation is snapped to a step that grows as zoom drops, so
//! the low-detail zooms spend far fewer distinct byte values and compress much harder.
//!
//! For terrarium the step is `(1/256) * 2^round_digits`, so `round_digits = 8` is exactly one
//! metre - and at whole metres the blue channel, which carries the sub-metre fraction, becomes a
//! constant zero. That cliff is where terrarium's size advantage over mapbox comes from; at
//! matched fractional steps mapbox is the smaller of the two.
