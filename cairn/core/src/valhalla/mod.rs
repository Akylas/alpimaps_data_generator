//! Valhalla routing packages.

//! A package is an mbtiles-shaped SQLite file (`zoom_level, tile_column, tile_row, tile_data`,
//! `format=gph3`) holding gzipped Valhalla graph tiles. The `zoom_level` column is Valhalla's
//! hierarchy level, not a map zoom, and the column/row are its graph tile coordinates.
