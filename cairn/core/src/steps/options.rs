//! Declarative option schema for build steps.
//!
//! The point is that the GUI never hard-codes a form: it renders whatever these definitions
//! say, and the same definitions turn the collected values back into a command line. That keeps
//! the form and the argv in step, and makes the argv testable without running anything.
//!
//! Every flag name here was read out of the sources rather than remembered - the stock ones from
//! `PlanetilerConfig`, the custom ones from the fork's `Route`/`Landcover` layers. Planetiler's
//! `Arguments` treats `-` and `_` in a flag name as equivalent, so `--simplify-tolerance` and
//! `--simplify_tolerance` reach the same setting.
//!
//! Defaults are deliberately *absent*. An option carries a `hint` describing what planetiler
//! does when the flag is omitted, but the schema never asserts that value - so an unset option
//! emits nothing and planetiler's own default stands, instead of this file's guess about it.
